            <p class="hrsgtext">When Is the Best Time to Visit Bacolod?</p>
    
            <p class="prsgtext">Most locals would agree that October would be the best time to visit Bacolod. This is because October is the month when the world-famous MassKara festival is observed.</p>
    
            <p class="prsgtext">During MassKara, various events such as food festivals, cultural shows, street dancing, street parties, and free concerts are held in the weeks leading up to the culmination of the festival on the last Sunday of October. The end of the festival coincides neatly with the school semestral break and the observance of All Saints’ and All Souls’ Day, both of which are special days for pious Catholic Filipinos.</p>
    
            <p class="toshow hidden prsgtext">If you're planning to visit Bacolod for MassKara, make sure to book your room at Go Hotels a few months in advance. MassKara attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists each year, so hotels in Bacolod are usually fully booked at this time, especially the ones located in ideal spots such as Go Hotels.</p>
    
            <p class="toshow hidden prsgtext">If you're not able to make the MassKara festival this year, don't worry. Bacolod has mild weather all year round, which makes it a nice place to visit at virtually any time of the year. The rainiest months tend to be from June to October and the hottest months are from March to April. The coolest and driest time of the year tends to be January, so schedule your trip around that time if you’re planning outdoor activities.</p>
